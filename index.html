        <h2>Oscar Wilde Arrested!</h2>
        <p>The <i>Wilde Trials International News Archive</i> gathers international news reports
          covering the three trials of the Irish writer Oscar Wilde (1854-1900). Wilde’s trials were
          a global media event in the spring of 1895, triggering important debates about gender and
          sexuality, as well as art, justice, and press standards. You can now read, search, and
          compare news reports from around the world to learn how journalists reported the news and
          shaped opinion about the writer's trials and punishment. <a href="about.html">Read
