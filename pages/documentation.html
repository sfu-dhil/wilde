                    <p><i>The Wilde Trials International Archive</i> is a textbase and text-sharing
                        detection program for analyzing international news reports about the three
                        trials and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde. Wilde’s three trials were an
                        international media event in the spring of 1895 and were front­page news the
                        world over for nearly a two-month period, triggering debates about
                        sexuality, justice, and press standards. The textbase contains news reports
                        published in 1895 which have been gathered from newspapers around the world
                        in a number of languages.</p>

                        </figure>
                       
                            <p>Paris has the greatest number of associated reports and so its tile is entirely filled with a darker colour; there are fewer reports associated with New Orleans and thus its tile has a shorter background. Note, however, that these backgrounds display the distribution of reports on a logarithmic (rather than linear) scale.</p>
