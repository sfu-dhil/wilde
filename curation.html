      <h2>Newspaper Curation</h2>
      <p>The <i>Wilde Trials International News Archive</i> currently features European and North American news reports on the Wilde trials, and includes representative news coverage from
        nineteen countries.</p>
      <p>The majority of the reports have been sourced from digitised newspaper collections. These
        include large open-access national collections, as well as multi-title commercial databases.
        Smaller digitised collections devoted to individual titles have also been important
        sources.</p>
      <p>To ensure a diversity of content, the archive also includes reports from non-digitised
        newspapers. National collections generally prioritise the digitisation of major titles,
        rather than specialist and foreign-language newspapers. As foreign-language newspapers are
        important sites of transnational cultural exchange, many of those that carried reports on
        the trials have been transcribed by hand at collection sites from print and microfilm
        sources.</p>
      <p>News reports differ widely in format across different newspapers, and sometimes even within
        a newspaper. Some reports appear as stand-alone items; others add on additional
        late-arriving telegraphic dispatches; yet others are mixed with other news items in
        longer columns. In each case, the archive counts these as single reports. </p>
      <p>Where reports originally appeared in columns containing unrelated news, the unrelated news
        has been stripped from the text. Links to the facsimile page allow for the consultation of
        news in wider context.</p>
       <p>The entire list of news reports can be accessed on <a href="list-nocache.html">All Reports</a> page. </p>

      <h2>Transcriptions &amp; Translations</h2>
      <p>The text for most of the news reports in the archive is computer generated using optical
        character recognition technologies (OCR). All OCR text has been edited for errors.
        Non-digitised reports have been been transcribed by hand as accurately as possible.</p>
      <p>The original formatting of the news reports is not strictly preserved, as the archive's
        primary interest is in the text of the reports rather than their appearance, and the
        text-comparison tools necessitate standardised encoding of line breaks and crossheads.</p>
      <p>Transcriptions of news reports are checked and corrected for high accuracy, but not at an editorial standard. The transcriptions aim to provide a good quality text for reading as well as for computational text comparison.  Many hands have been involved in the correction and transcription process, acknowledged in
        the <a href="contributors.html">Contributors</a> page. </p>
         <p>Machine translations of news reports are available for non-English reports into English,
        using the Google Cloud Translation API. These translations have not been corrected and are
        not polished. They are meant as a bridge for understanding and analysis.</p>
    

      <h2>Bibliographic, Matching, &amp; Network Metadata</h2>
      <p>Each news report includes basic bibliographic metadata about the newspaper from which it
        was derived, as well as date of publication, word count, and source information. If sourced
        from open-access databases, a link to the facsimile is provided. In the case of certain
        older databases, however, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the report.</p>
      <p>For each news report, there is also “document match” metadata provided, as well as links to
        those reports. The archive’s text-comparison tools identify which other reports match at the
        document level. The percentage indicates the amount of text-matching between reports. Levenshtein
        is the measure used to determine the similarity between news reports. It measures the number of different characters between two sequences of texts. </p>
      <p>Next to each report are match buttons. These show the number of similar paragraphs from
        other reports found across the collection. Selecting these match buttons enables you to
        follow links that show side-by-side comparisons of reports that match at the document level
        or have matching paragraphs.</p>
